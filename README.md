# Discord.JS-Basic
In this repo, I am writing a basic tutorial in how to create a discord bot. In this we
will be using discordJS v13.10.2.

# Useful-Links
* Discord Dev Portal: https://discord.com/developers/applications
* Discord Guide: https://discordjs.guide/

# Requirements
To start off there will be a few things that you will need:
* An IDE, I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download/).
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

# Initialisation
To start off with you will need to login or register an account on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
Once you`ve done that, you should see something similar to this:

You will need to click ```New Application```, in which you will be greeted with a pop-up asking you to name the application, give it a name and click the promt to say you agree with the Terms of Service and Policy then click create.
